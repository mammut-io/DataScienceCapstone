# Data Science Capstone Course

## Course Tasks
This course will be separated into 8 different tasks that cover the range of activities encountered by a practicing data scientist. They mirror many of the skills developed in the data science specialization. The tasks are:

- Understanding the problem
- Data acquisition and cleaning
- Exploratory analysis
- Statistical modeling
- Predictive modeling
- Creative exploration
- Creating a data product
- Creating a short slide deck pitching your product

## Course dataset
This is the training data to get you started that will be the basis for most of the capstone. You must download the data from the Coursera site and not from external websites to start.

Later in the course you may use external data sets to augment your model as you see fit.
